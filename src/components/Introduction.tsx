After years in tech, with the last 10 spent working in embedded Linux development, I've recently shifted my focus toward modern full-stack web development. Over the past two years, I've been sharpening my skills with tools like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, and <strong>TypeScript</strong>.

        What I love most about web development is being able to <em>see</em> and <em>interact</em> with what I build. I enjoy both the logic of the backend and the creativity of the frontend, with a strong focus on React.

        I'm currently open to <strong>local or remote opportunities</strong>, and I'm always looking to grow. My goal is to land a full-time role where I can keep learning, stay creative, and contribute to meaningful projects.
